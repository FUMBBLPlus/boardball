FFB Client Boardball Mod v0.1
=============================


Installation
------------

1. Unpack the ZIP file content into a directory which is not the
   Program Files.
2. On FUMBBL, click on a Play or Spectate link. A JNLP file gets
   downloaded. If it starts automatically then you should right
   click on the link and choose "Save Link as" or something like
   that.
3. The downloaded JNL file should be listed in the Downloads bar
   or menu of your Browser.

   Depending on your configuration, when you click on the JNLP
   file...

   a) you might get asked what to do with that file in a dialog.
      In this case, Java Web Start Launcher is probably the
      candidate for opening the JNLP. You should be able to set
      a different program for this and that is what you should
      do. Browse and select Boardball.exe. You should have an
      option to make it the default program which you probably
      not want to do.

   b) FFB client might get started automatically.
      In this case, right click on the JNLP and select "Show in
      Folder" or something like that. Windows Explorer should
      open with the JNLP file selected. Right click on the file
      and select "Open with" and then "Choose Deafalt
      Program...". In the window, clikc on the Browse icon and
      add Boardball.exe. You might want to deselect "Always use
      the selected program to open this kind of file".



   If Java starts immediately when you click on the JNLP file


   you click on it, Java might get started automatically.
