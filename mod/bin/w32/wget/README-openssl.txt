This archive is for those who want only OpenSSL without GetGnuWin32.

If you use GetGnuWin32:
This more recent version of OpenSSL will be automatically downloaded 
the next time the user runs download.bat. It will be offered for 
supplemental installation the next time the user runs install.bat.

For more information or to work with the source I used to compile you 
can download BUILD_FILES_openssl-1.0.2h.zip:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/getgnuwin32/0.6.30/source/

SHA1 file hashes are available via HTTPS only if you are logged in to 
your sourceforge account:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/getgnuwin32/0.6.30/source/BUILD_FILES_openssl-1.0.2h.sha/view

The above URLs are only valid for as long as this archive remains my 
latest compile.
