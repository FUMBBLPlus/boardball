FFB Client Boardball Mod v1.1.0
===============================


System Requirements
-------------------
Windows PC with JRE/JDK installed.


Installation
------------

1. Download the ZIP file:

   https://github.com/FUMBBLPlus/boardball/releases/download/mod/boardball.zip

2. Unpack the ZIP file content into a directory.

3. Run the setup.bat file.

   If errors were reported then you have to associate boardball.exe with JNLP
   files manually. At (4) of the Start process (see below) you will not find
   boardball.exe in the context menu, but there should be an option to add it,
   either by clicking on Open With or Open With > Choose default program and
   then by clicking on the Browse button.

Note that the common FFB client remains the default application/option to play
and spectate.


Uninstallation
--------------
Start both of the REG files in the troubleshoot folder.


Update
------

If you intend to keep new files in place of the old ones, update is done by
downloading the new ZIP file and unpacking and overwriting all the previous
ones.

If you intend to keep new files in a different location then uninstall
boardball and do a new installation.


Start
-----

1. Click on a Play or Spectate link in FUMBBL. Either you will

   a) be able to open the JNLP file with Boardball immediately
   b) or you are able to save the file.

   In case of (a), you are done.

2. The downloaded JNLP file should be listed in the Downloads bar or menu of your
   Browser.

3. Right click on the JNLP and select "Show in Folder" or something like that.
   Windows Explorer should open with the JNLP file selected.

4. Right click on the selected file and you should be able to open it with
   Boardball by choosing "Open With" entry of the context menu.

Once started, please do the recommended Client Setup (below).

  Boardball board got hacked to replace the default pitch.
